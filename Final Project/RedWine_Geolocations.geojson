    "descrption":"Spicy and peppery, with lots of body and richness. In a word, it's true Carmenère. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. The finish is tight and long, with some espresso flavor. If you're interested in trying a well-made Carmenère, give this a go.",
